## Introduction
These queries were built for Amazon's internal ETL system to run as automated reports displaying daily inventory/process metrics in a digestible format.  For all I know, some of these queries may be running to this day, but the files in this repository are archived, lightly redacted copies of the original queries.  The dates on each file name roughly correspond to when I completed them.

As an analyst, I had access to data tables on storage capacity, inventory records, employee details, purchase orders, and outbound shipments for Amazon fulfillment centers around the world.  All of these queries were originally written in order to pull, join, and transform these data for the specific warehouse at which I worked, but most of them are parameterized with wildcards so that the Amazon ETL system could substitute in other warehouse codes and get a comparable report.  Several of my queries were thus used more widely within the Amazon fulfillment network, with jobs for those queries running every day for multiple warehouses.

Most of these queries report on inventory quality or storage capacity metrics of some kind.  They mostly use basic operators like SELECT, WHERE, JOIN, GROUP BY, HAVING, CASE WHEN, etc, but some of them involve complex series of joins and/or a high degree of filtering.
